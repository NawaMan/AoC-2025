/**
 * --- Day 25: Code Chronicle ---
 * 
 * Out of ideas and time, The Historians agree that they should go back to check the Chief Historian's office one last 
 *   time, just in case he went back there without you noticing.
 * 
 * When you get there, you are surprised to discover that the door to his office is locked! You can hear someone inside, 
 *   but knocking yields no response. The locks on this floor are all fancy, expensive, virtual versions of five-pin 
 *   tumbler locks, so you contact North Pole security to see if they can help open the door.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, they've lost track of which locks are installed and which keys go with them, so the best they can do 
 * is send over schematics of every lock and every key for the floor you're on (your puzzle input).
 * 
 * The schematics are in a cryptic file format, but they do contain manufacturer information, so you look up their 
 *   support number.
 * 
 * "Our Virtual Five-Pin Tumbler product? That's our most expensive model! Way more secure than--" You explain that you 
 *   need to open a door and don't have a lot of time.
 * 
 * "Well, you can't know whether a key opens a lock without actually trying the key in the lock (due to quantum hidden 
 *   variables), but you can rule out some of the key/lock combinations."
 * 
 * "The virtual system is complicated, but part of it really is a crude simulation of a five-pin tumbler lock, mostly 
 *   for marketing reasons. If you look at the schematics, you can figure out whether a key could possibly fit in a lock."
 * 
 * He transmits you some example schematics:
 * 
 * #####
 * .####
 * .####
 * .####
 * .#.#.
 * .#...
 * .....
 * 
 * #####
 * ##.##
 * .#.##
 * ...##
 * ...#.
 * ...#.
 * .....
 * 
 * .....
 * #....
 * #....
 * #...#
 * #.#.#
 * #.###
 * #####
 * 
 * .....
 * .....
 * #.#..
 * ###..
 * ###.#
 * ###.#
 * #####
 * 
 * .....
 * .....
 * .....
 * #....
 * #.#..
 * #.#.#
 * #####
 * 
 * "The locks are schematics that have the top row filled (#) and the bottom row empty (.); the keys have the top row 
 *   empty and the bottom row filled. If you look closely, you'll see that each schematic is actually a set of columns 
 *   of various heights, either extending downward from the top (for locks) or upward from the bottom (for keys)."
 * 
 * "For locks, those are the pins themselves; you can convert the pins in schematics to a list of heights, one per column. 
 *   For keys, the columns make up the shape of the key where it aligns with pins; those can also be converted to a list 
 *   of heights."
 * 
 * "So, you could say the first lock has pin heights 0,5,3,4,3:"
 * 
 * #####
 * .####
 * .####
 * .####
 * .#.#.
 * .#...
 * .....
 * 
 * "Or, that the first key has heights 5,0,2,1,3:"
 * 
 * .....
 * #....
 * #....
 * #...#
 * #.#.#
 * #.###
 * #####
 * 
 * "These seem like they should fit together; in the first four columns, the pins and key don't overlap. However, this 
 *   key cannot be for this lock: in the rightmost column, the lock's pin overlaps with the key, which you know because 
 *   in that column the sum of the lock height and key height is more than the available space."
 * 
 * "So anyway, you can narrow down the keys you'd need to try by just testing each key with each lock, which means you 
 *   would have to check... wait, you have how many locks? But the only installation that size is at the North--" 
 *   You disconnect the call.
 * 
 * In this example, converting both locks to pin heights produces:
 * 
 * 0,5,3,4,3
 * 1,2,0,5,3
 * 
 * Converting all three keys to heights produces:
 * 
 * 5,0,2,1,3
 * 4,3,4,0,2
 * 3,0,2,0,1
 * 
 * Then, you can try every key with every lock:
 * 
 *     Lock 0,5,3,4,3 and key 5,0,2,1,3: overlap in the last column.
 *     Lock 0,5,3,4,3 and key 4,3,4,0,2: overlap in the second column.
 *     Lock 0,5,3,4,3 and key 3,0,2,0,1: all columns fit!
 *     Lock 1,2,0,5,3 and key 5,0,2,1,3: overlap in the first column.
 *     Lock 1,2,0,5,3 and key 4,3,4,0,2: all columns fit!
 *     Lock 1,2,0,5,3 and key 3,0,2,0,1: all columns fit!
 * 
 * So, in this example, the number of unique lock/key pairs that fit together without overlapping in any column is 3.
 * 
 * Analyze your lock and key schematics. How many unique lock/key pairs fit together without overlapping in any column?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 2933.
 * 
 * The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
