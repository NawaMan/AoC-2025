/**
 * --- Day 17: Chronospatial Computer ---
 * 
 * The Historians push the button on their strange device, but this time, you all just feel like you're falling.
 * 
 * "Situation critical", the device announces in a familiar voice. "Bootstrapping process failed. Initializing 
 *   debugger...."
 * 
 * The small handheld device suddenly unfolds into an entire computer! The Historians look around nervously before one 
 *   of them tosses it to you.
 * 
 * This seems to be a 3-bit computer: its program is a list of 3-bit numbers (0 through 7), like 0,1,2,3. The computer 
 *   also has three registers named A, B, and C, but these registers aren't limited to 3 bits and can instead hold any 
 *   integer.
 * 
 * The computer knows eight instructions, each identified by a 3-bit number (called the instruction's opcode). Each 
 *   instruction also reads the 3-bit number after it as an input; this is called its operand.
 * 
 * A number called the instruction pointer identifies the position in the program from which the next opcode will be 
 *   read; it starts at 0, pointing at the first 3-bit number in the program. Except for jump instructions, 
 *   the instruction pointer increases by 2 after each instruction is processed (to move past the instruction's opcode 
 *   and its operand). If the computer tries to read an opcode past the end of the program, it instead halts.
 * 
 * So, the program 0,1,2,3 would run the instruction whose opcode is 0 and pass it the operand 1, then run the instruction 
 *   having opcode 2 and pass it the operand 3, then halt.
 * 
 * There are two types of operands; each instruction specifies the type of its operand. The value of a literal operand 
 *   is the operand itself. For example, the value of the literal operand 7 is the number 7. The value of a combo operand
 *   can be found as follows:
 * 
 *     Combo operands 0 through 3 represent literal values 0 through 3.
 *     Combo operand 4 represents the value of register A.
 *     Combo operand 5 represents the value of register B.
 *     Combo operand 6 represents the value of register C.
 *     Combo operand 7 is reserved and will not appear in valid programs.
 * 
 * The eight instructions are as follows:
 * 
 * The adv instruction (opcode 0) performs division. The numerator is the value in the A register. The denominator 
 *   is found by raising 2 to the power of the instruction's combo operand. (So, an operand of 2 would divide A by 
 *   4 (2^2); an operand of 5 would divide A by 2^B.) The result of the division operation is truncated to an integer 
 *   and then written to the A register.
 * 
 * The bxl instruction (opcode 1) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and the instruction's literal operand, 
 *   then stores the result in register B.
 * 
 * The bst instruction (opcode 2) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8 (thereby keeping only its lowest 
 *   3 bits), then writes that value to the B register.
 * 
 * The jnz instruction (opcode 3) does nothing if the A register is 0. However, if the A register is not zero, it jumps 
 *   by setting the instruction pointer to the value of its literal operand; if this instruction jumps, the instruction 
 *   pointer is not increased by 2 after this instruction.
 * 
 * The bxc instruction (opcode 4) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and register C, then stores the result in 
 *   register B. (For legacy reasons, this instruction reads an operand but ignores it.)
 * 
 * The out instruction (opcode 5) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8, then outputs that value. (If a 
 *   program outputs multiple values, they are separated by commas.)
 * 
 * The bdv instruction (opcode 6) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the B register. 
 *   (The numerator is still read from the A register.)
 * 
 * The cdv instruction (opcode 7) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the C register. 
 *   (The numerator is still read from the A register.)
 * 
 * Here are some examples of instruction operation:
 * 
 *     If register C contains 9, the program 2,6 would set register B to 1.
 *     If register A contains 10, the program 5,0,5,1,5,4 would output 0,1,2.
 *     If register A contains 2024, the program 0,1,5,4,3,0 would output 4,2,5,6,7,7,7,7,3,1,0 and leave 0 in register A.
 *     If register B contains 29, the program 1,7 would set register B to 26.
 *     If register B contains 2024 and register C contains 43690, the program 4,0 would set register B to 44354.
 * 
 * The Historians' strange device has finished initializing its debugger and is displaying some information about 
 *   the program it is trying to run (your puzzle input). For example:
 * 
 * Register A: 729
 * Register B: 0
 * Register C: 0
 * 
 * Program: 0,1,5,4,3,0
 * 
 * Your first task is to determine what the program is trying to output. To do this, initialize the registers to 
 *   the given values, then run the given program, collecting any output produced by out instructions. (Always join 
 *   the values produced by out instructions with commas.) After the above program halts, its final output will be 
 *   4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0.
 * 
 * Using the information provided by the debugger, initialize the registers to the given values, then run the program. 
 *   Once it halts, what do you get if you use commas to join the values it output into a single string?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 6,2,7,2,3,1,6,0,5.
