/**
 * --- Day 23: LAN Party ---
 * 
 * As The Historians wander around a secure area at Easter Bunny HQ, you come across posters for a LAN party scheduled 
 *   for today! Maybe you can find it; you connect to a nearby datalink port and download a map of the local network 
 *   (your puzzle input).
 * 
 * The network map provides a list of every connection between two computers. For example:
 * 
 * kh-tc
 * qp-kh
 * de-cg
 * ka-co
 * yn-aq
 * qp-ub
 * cg-tb
 * vc-aq
 * tb-ka
 * wh-tc
 * yn-cg
 * kh-ub
 * ta-co
 * de-co
 * tc-td
 * tb-wq
 * wh-td
 * ta-ka
 * td-qp
 * aq-cg
 * wq-ub
 * ub-vc
 * de-ta
 * wq-aq
 * wq-vc
 * wh-yn
 * ka-de
 * kh-ta
 * co-tc
 * wh-qp
 * tb-vc
 * td-yn
 * 
 * Each line of text in the network map represents a single connection; the line kh-tc represents a connection between 
 *   the computer named kh and the computer named tc. Connections aren't directional; tc-kh would mean exactly the same 
 *   thing.
 * 
 * LAN parties typically involve multiplayer games, so maybe you can locate it by finding groups of connected computers. 
 *   Start by looking for sets of three computers where each computer in the set is connected to the other two computers.
 * 
 * In this example, there are 12 such sets of three inter-connected computers:
 * 
 * aq,cg,yn
 * aq,vc,wq
 * co,de,ka
 * co,de,ta
 * co,ka,ta
 * de,ka,ta
 * kh,qp,ub
 * qp,td,wh
 * tb,vc,wq
 * tc,td,wh
 * td,wh,yn
 * ub,vc,wq
 * 
 * If the Chief Historian is here, and he's at the LAN party, it would be best to know that right away. You're pretty 
 *   sure his computer's name starts with t, so consider only sets of three computers where at least one computer's name
 *   starts with t. That narrows the list down to 7 sets of three inter-connected computers:
 * 
 * co,de,ta
 * co,ka,ta
 * de,ka,ta
 * qp,td,wh
 * tb,vc,wq
 * tc,td,wh
 * td,wh,yn
 * 
 * Find all the sets of three inter-connected computers. How many contain at least one computer with a name that starts 
 *   with t?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 1238.
