/**
 * --- Day 21: Keypad Conundrum ---
 * 
 * As you teleport onto Santa's Reindeer-class starship, The Historians begin to panic: someone from their search party 
 *   is missing. A quick life-form scan by the ship's computer reveals that when the missing Historian teleported, he 
 *   arrived in another part of the ship.
 * 
 * The door to that area is locked, but the computer can't open it; it can only be opened by physically typing the door 
 *   codes (your puzzle input) on the numeric keypad on the door.
 * 
 * The numeric keypad has four rows of buttons: 789, 456, 123, and finally an empty gap followed by 0A. Visually, they 
 *   are arranged like this:
 * 
 * +---+---+---+
 * | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 * +---+---+---+
 * | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 * +---+---+---+
 * | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 * +---+---+---+
 *     | 0 | A |
 *     +---+---+
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the area outside the door is currently depressurized and nobody can go near the door. A robot needs to 
 *   be sent instead.
 * 
 * The robot has no problem navigating the ship and finding the numeric keypad, but it's not designed for button pushing:
 *   it can't be told to push a specific button directly. Instead, it has a robotic arm that can be controlled remotely 
 *   via a directional keypad.
 * 
 * The directional keypad has two rows of buttons: a gap / ^ (up) / A (activate) on the first row and < (left) / v (down) 
 *   / > (right) on the second row. Visually, they are arranged like this:
 * 
 *     +---+---+
 *     | ^ | A |
 * +---+---+---+
 * | < | v | > |
 * +---+---+---+
 * 
 * When the robot arrives at the numeric keypad, its robotic arm is pointed at the A button in the bottom right corner. 
 *   After that, this directional keypad remote control must be used to maneuver the robotic arm: the up / down / left 
 *   / right buttons cause it to move its arm one button in that direction, and the A button causes the robot to briefly
 *   move forward, pressing the button being aimed at by the robotic arm.
 * 
 * For example, to make the robot type 029A on the numeric keypad, one sequence of inputs on the directional keypad you 
 *   could use is:
 * 
 *     < to move the arm from A (its initial position) to 0.
 *     A to push the 0 button.
 *     ^A to move the arm to the 2 button and push it.
 *     >^^A to move the arm to the 9 button and push it.
 *     vvvA to move the arm to the A button and push it.
 * 
 * In total, there are three shortest possible sequences of button presses on this directional keypad that would cause 
 *   the robot to type 029A: <A^A>^^AvvvA, <A^A^>^AvvvA, and <A^A^^>AvvvA.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the area containing this directional keypad remote control is currently experiencing high levels of 
 *   radiation and nobody can go near it. A robot needs to be sent instead.
 * 
 * When the robot arrives at the directional keypad, its robot arm is pointed at the A button in the upper right corner.
 *   After that, a second, different directional keypad remote control is used to control this robot (in the same way as
 *   the first robot, except that this one is typing on a directional keypad instead of a numeric keypad).
 * 
 * There are multiple shortest possible sequences of directional keypad button presses that would cause this robot to 
 *   tell the first robot to type 029A on the door. One such sequence is v<<A>>^A<A>AvA<^AA>A<vAAA>^A.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the area containing this second directional keypad remote control is currently -40 degrees! Another 
 *   robot will need to be sent to type on that directional keypad, too.
 * 
 * There are many shortest possible sequences of directional keypad button presses that would cause this robot to tell 
 *   the second robot to tell the first robot to eventually type 029A on the door. One such sequence is 
 *   <vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AvA^A<vA>^A<v<A>^A>AAvA^A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the area containing this third directional keypad remote control is currently full of Historians, 
 *   so no robots can find a clear path there. Instead, you will have to type this sequence yourself.
 * 
 * Were you to choose this sequence of button presses, here are all of the buttons that would be pressed on your 
 *   directional keypad, the two robots' directional keypads, and the numeric keypad:
 * 
 * <vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AvA^A<vA>^A<v<A>^A>AAvA^A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A
 * v<<A>>^A<A>AvA<^AA>A<vAAA>^A
 * <A^A>^^AvvvA
 * 029A
 * 
 * In summary, there are the following keypads:
 * 
 *     One directional keypad that you are using.
 *     Two directional keypads that robots are using.
 *     One numeric keypad (on a door) that a robot is using.
 * 
 * It is important to remember that these robots are not designed for button pushing. In particular, if a robot arm is 
 *   ever aimed at a gap where no button is present on the keypad, even for an instant, the robot will panic 
 *   unrecoverably. So, don't do that. All robots will initially aim at the keypad's A key, wherever it is.
 * 
 * To unlock the door, five codes will need to be typed on its numeric keypad. For example:
 * 
 * 029A
 * 980A
 * 179A
 * 456A
 * 379A
 * 
 * For each of these, here is a shortest sequence of button presses you could type to cause the desired code to be typed
 *   on the numeric keypad:
 * 
 * 029A: <vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AvA^A<vA>^A<v<A>^A>AAvA^A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A
 * 980A: <v<A>>^AAAvA^A<vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A<vA>^A<A>A
 * 179A: <v<A>>^A<vA<A>>^AAvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AAvA^A<vA>^AA<A>A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A
 * 456A: <v<A>>^AA<vA<A>>^AAvAA<^A>A<vA>^A<A>A<vA>^A<A>A<v<A>A>^AAvA<^A>A
 * 379A: <v<A>>^AvA^A<vA<AA>>^AAvA<^A>AAvA^A<vA>^AA<A>A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A
 * 
 * The Historians are getting nervous; the ship computer doesn't remember whether the missing Historian is trapped in 
 *   the area containing a giant electromagnet or molten lava. You'll need to make sure that for each of the five codes,
 *   you find the shortest sequence of button presses necessary.
 * 
 * The complexity of a single code (like 029A) is equal to the result of multiplying these two values:
 * 
 *     The length of the shortest sequence of button presses you need to type on your directional keypad in order 
 *       to cause the code to be typed on the numeric keypad; for 029A, this would be 68.
 *     The numeric part of the code (ignoring leading zeroes); for 029A, this would be 29.
 * 
 * In the above example, complexity of the five codes can be found by calculating 68 * 29, 60 * 980, 68 * 179, 64 * 456,
 *   and 64 * 379. Adding these together produces 126384.
 * 
 * Find the fewest number of button presses you'll need to perform in order to cause the robot in front of the door 
 *   to type each code. What is the sum of the complexities of the five codes on your list?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 188384.
