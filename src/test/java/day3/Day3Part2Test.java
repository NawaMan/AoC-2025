/**
 * --- Part Two ---
 * 
 * As you scan through the corrupted memory, you notice that some of the conditional statements are also still intact.
 *   If you handle some of the uncorrupted conditional statements in the program, you might be able to get an even more
 *   accurate result.
 * 
 * There are two new instructions you'll need to handle:
 * 
 *     The do() instruction enables future mul instructions.
 *     The don't() instruction disables future mul instructions.
 * 
 * Only the most recent do() or don't() instruction applies. At the beginning of the program, mul instructions are
 *   enabled.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))
 * 
 * This corrupted memory is similar to the example from before, but this time the mul(5,5) and mul(11,8) instructions
 *   are disabled because there is a don't() instruction before them. The other mul instructions function normally,
 *   including the one at the end that gets re-enabled by a do() instruction.
 * 
 * This time, the sum of the results is 48 (2*4 + 8*5).
 * 
 * Handle the new instructions; what do you get if you add up all of the results of just the enabled multiplications?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 98729041.
