/**
 * --- Part Two ---
 * 
 * The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell you about the
 *   Problem Dampener.
 * 
 * The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single bad level in
 *   what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened!
 * 
 * Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the
 *   report instead counts as safe.
 * 
 * More of the above example's reports are now safe:
 * 
 *     7 6 4 2 1: Safe without removing any level.
 *     1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
 *     9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
 *     1 3 2 4 5: Safe by removing the second level, 3.
 *     8 6 4 4 1: Safe by removing the third level, 4.
 *     1 3 6 7 9: Safe without removing any level.
 * 
 * Thanks to the Problem Dampener, 4 reports are actually safe!
 * 
 * Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports.
 *   How many reports are now safe?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 465.
