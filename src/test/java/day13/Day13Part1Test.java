/**
 * --- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---
 * 
 * Next up: the lobby of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles
 *   before spreading out.
 * 
 * Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new arcade! Maybe you can win some prizes from the claw machines?
 * 
 * The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these 
 *   machines have two buttons labeled A and B. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs 3 tokens to push
 *   the A button and 1 token to push the B button.
 * 
 * With a little experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific
 *   amount to the right (along the X axis) and a specific amount forward (along the Y axis) each time that button is 
 *   pressed.
 * 
 * Each machine contains one prize; to win the prize, the claw must be positioned exactly above the prize on both the X 
 *   and Y axes.
 * 
 * You wonder: what is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible? You 
 *   assemble a list of every machine's button behavior and prize location (your puzzle input). For example:
 * 
 * Button A: X+94, Y+34
 * Button B: X+22, Y+67
 * Prize: X=8400, Y=5400
 * 
 * Button A: X+26, Y+66
 * Button B: X+67, Y+21
 * Prize: X=12748, Y=12176
 * 
 * Button A: X+17, Y+86
 * Button B: X+84, Y+37
 * Prize: X=7870, Y=6450
 * 
 * Button A: X+69, Y+23
 * Button B: X+27, Y+71
 * Prize: X=18641, Y=10279
 * 
 * This list describes the button configuration and prize location of four different claw machines.
 * 
 * For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:
 * 
 *     Pushing the machine's A button would move the claw 94 units along the X axis and 34 units along the Y axis.
 *     Pushing the B button would move the claw 22 units along the X axis and 67 units along the Y axis.
 *     The prize is located at X=8400, Y=5400; this means that from the claw's initial position, it would need to move 
 *       exactly 8400 units along the X axis and exactly 5400 units along the Y axis to be perfectly aligned with 
 *       the prize in this machine.
 * 
 * The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 80 times and the B button 40 times. This would line up 
 *   the claw along the X axis (because 80*94 + 40*22 = 8400) and along the Y axis (because 80*34 + 40*67 = 5400). 
 *   Doing this would cost 80*3 tokens for the A presses and 40*1 for the B presses, a total of 280 tokens.
 * 
 * For the second and fourth claw machines, there is no combination of A and B presses that will ever win a prize.
 * 
 * For the third claw machine, the cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 38 times and the B button 
 *   86 times. Doing this would cost a total of 200 tokens.
 * 
 * So, the most prizes you could possibly win is two; the minimum tokens you would have to spend to win all (two) prizes
 *   is 480.
 * 
 * You estimate that each button would need to be pressed no more than 100 times to win a prize. How else would someone 
 *   be expected to play?
 * 
 * Figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win 
 *   all possible prizes?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 39748.
