/**
 * As you go to win the first prize, you discover that the claw is nowhere near where you expected it would be. 
 *   Due to a unit conversion error in your measurements, the position of every prize is actually 10000000000000 higher 
 *   on both the X and Y axis!
 * 
 * Add 10000000000000 to the X and Y position of every prize. After making this change, the example above would now look
 *   like this:
 * 
 * Button A: X+94, Y+34
 * Button B: X+22, Y+67
 * Prize: X=10000000008400, Y=10000000005400
 * 
 * Button A: X+26, Y+66
 * Button B: X+67, Y+21
 * Prize: X=10000000012748, Y=10000000012176
 * 
 * Button A: X+17, Y+86
 * Button B: X+84, Y+37
 * Prize: X=10000000007870, Y=10000000006450
 * 
 * Button A: X+69, Y+23
 * Button B: X+27, Y+71
 * Prize: X=10000000018641, Y=10000000010279
 * 
 * Now, it is only possible to win a prize on the second and fourth claw machines. Unfortunately, it will take many more
 *   than 100 presses to do so.
 * 
 * Using the corrected prize coordinates, figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. What is the fewest tokens 
 *   you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?
 * 
 * Your puzzle answer was 74478585072604.
